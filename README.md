[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/popeindustries/buddy.png)](https://travis-ci.org/popeindustries/buddy)

# buddy(1)

**buddy(1)** is a build tool for js/css/html projects. It helps you manage third-party dependencies (optional add-on), compiles source code from higher order js/css/html languages (CoffeeScript/LiveScript/Handlebars/Stylus/Less/Jade/Twig), automatically wraps js files in module definitions, statically resolves module dependencies, and concatenates (and optionally compresses) all souces into a single file for more efficient delivery to the browser.

**Current version:** 0.12.4 *[See [Change Log](https://github.com/popeindustries/buddy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details]*

## Features

- Allows you to write js __modules__ without the module boilerplate (similar to Node.js)
- Resolves js module __dependencies__ automatically
- Supports efficient ___lazy___ runtime evaluation by storing js modules as strings
- Resolves all relative dependencies on __deploy__
- __Compiles__ _CoffeeScript_, _LiveScript_, _Handlebars_, _Stylus_, _Less_, _Twig_, and _Jade_ source files
- __Concatenates__ js modules into a single file
- Runs js and css code through __linters__ to check for syntax errors
- __Watches__ for source changes and builds automatically
- __Serves__ static files from specified directory on specified port
- __Refreshes__ connected browsers after each change
- __Inlines__ css `@imports` automatically
- Supports execution of a ___test___ script after each build
- [Add-on] Copies __packages__ from GitHub to your project
- [Add-on] Copies __assets__ from a local destination to your project

## Installation

To avoid running **buddy(1)** directly as a global command, and thus avoid versioning problems across different projects, it is highly recommended that you instead install the separate [buddy-cli](https://github.com/popeindustries/buddy-cli) command line interface system-wide:

```bash
$ npm -g install buddy-cli
```

...then create a *package.json* file for each project, locally installing **buddy** as a devDependency:

```json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  }
}
```
```bash
$ cd path/to/project
$ npm install
```

### Examples

*See [buddy-dependencies](https://github.com/popeindustries/buddy-dependencies) for `install` command examples.*

Generate `www/main.js` by concatenating and modularizing all dependencies in `src` or `libs/js` referenced in `src/main.js`:

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "simple-browser-require": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "build": {
      "js": {
        "sources": ["src", "libs/js"],
        "targets": [
          {
            "input": "src/main.js",
            "output": "www/main.js"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy build
```

Generate `www/main.js` with references to dependencies installed via npm:

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "simple-browser-require": "*"
    "underscore": "1.4.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "build": {
      "js": {
        "sources": ["src"],
        "targets": [
          {
            "input": "src/main.js",
            "output": "www/main.js"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy build
```

First compile all CoffeeScript files in `libs/src/coffee`, then generate `www/main.js` by concatenating and modularizing all dependencies referenced in 'src/main.js':

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "simple-browser-require": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "build": {
      "js": {
        "sources": ["src", "libs/js", "libs/src/coffee"],
        "targets": [
          {
            "input": "libs/src/coffee",
            "output": "libs/js"
          },
          {
            "input": "src/main.js",
            "output": "www/main.js"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy build
```

Generate `www/main.js` and an additional widget `www/widget.js` using shared sources (avoid duplicating dependencies):

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "simple-browser-require": "*"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "build": {
      "js": {
        "sources": ["src", "libs/js"],
        "targets": [
          {
            "input": "src/main.js",
            "output": "www/main.js",
            "targets": [
              {
                "input": "src/widget.js",
                "output": "www/widget.js"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy build
```

Compile a CoffeeScript project for Node.js, skipping module wrapping and concatenation:

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my server project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "build": {
      "js": {
        "sources": ["src/coffee"],
        "targets": [
          {
            "input": "src/coffee",
            "output": "js",
            "modular": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy build
```

Start a basic web server and refresh the browser (using the Live-Reload browser plugin) after each build triggered by source file changes:

```json
package.json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "description": "This is my web project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "buddy": "0.12.0"
  },
  "buddy": {
    "settings": {
      "server": {
        "directory": "www",
        "port": 8080
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```bash
$ buddy watch -rs
```

### Configuration

Complete annotated `buddy.js` configuration file:

```js
// Project build configuration.
exports.build = {
  js: {
    // Directories containing potential js source files for this project ('node_modules' are added by default).
    sources: ['a/coffeescript/source/directory', 'a/js/source/directory'],
    // One or more js build targets.
    targets: [
      {
        // An entrypoint js (or equivalent) file to be wrapped in a module definition,
        // concatenated with all it's resolved dependencies.
        input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/file',
        // A destination in which to save the processed input.
        // If a directory is specified, the input file name will be used.
        output: 'a/js/file/or/directory',
        // An alternate destination in which to save the compressed output.
        output_compressed: 'a/js/file/or/directory',
        // Targets can have children.
        // Any sources included in the parent target will NOT be included in the child.
        targets: [
          {
            input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/file',
            output: 'a/js/file/or/directory'
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        // Files are batch processed when a directory is used as input.
        input: 'a/coffeescript/or/js/directory',
        output: 'a/js/directory',
        // Skips module wrapping (ex: for use in server environments).
        modular: false
      }
    ]
  },
  css: {
    // Directories containing potential css source files for this project.
    sources: ['a/stylus/directory', 'a/less/directory', 'a/css/directory'],
    // One or more css build targets
    targets: [
      {

        // concatenated with all it's resolved dependencies.
        input: 'a/stylus/less/or/css/file',
        // A destination in which to save the processed input.
        // If a directory is specified, the input file name will be used.
        output: 'a/css/file/or/directory'
      },
      {
        // Files are batch processed when a directory is used as input,
        // though @import'ed dependencies are still resolved and inlined.
        input: 'a/stylus/less/or/css/directory',
        output: 'a/css/directory'
      }
    ]
  }
}

// Project dependency configuration.
exports.dependencies = {
  // A destination directory in which to place third-party library dependencies.
  // Alternatively, a destination file for packaging/minification
  'a/vendor/directory': {
    // An ordered list of dependencies
    sources: [
      // A github user/repo.
      // Install the 'browser-require' source when using Node-style modules.
      'popeindustries/browser-require',
      // A named library with or without version (ex: jquery@latest, backbone, backbone@1.0.0).
      // Version identifiers follow the npm semantic versioning rules.
      'library@version'
    ],
    // Dependencies can be packaged and minified to a destination file
    output: 'a/js/file'
  },
  // A destination directory in which to place source library dependencies.
  'a/source/directory': {
    sources: [
      // A github user/repo.
      // Will use the 'main' properties of
      // components.json or package.json to identify the file to install.
      'username/repo',
      // A github user/repo with specific file or directory locations.
      'username/repo#a/file/or/directory|another/file/or/directory',
      // A local file or directory to copy and install.
      '../a/file/or/directory'
    ]
  }
}

// Project settings configuration.
exports.settings = {
  // Run a command after build
  test: 'command --flags',
  // Configure webserver
  server: {
    // Defaults to project root
    directory: 'a/project/directory',
    // Defaults to 8080
    port: 8000
  }
}
```

## Concepts

### BUILD

**Project Root**: The directory from which all paths resolve to. Determined by location of the configuration file.

**Sources**: An array of directories from which all referenced files are retrieved from. ***Note:*** A *js* module's id is derived from it's relative path to it's source directory.

**Targets**: Objects that specify the *input* and *output* files or directories for each build. Targets are built in sequence, allowing builds to be chained together. ***Note:*** A *js* target can also have nested child targets, ensuring that dependencies are not duplicated across related builds.

**Target parameters**:

- *input*: file or directory to build. If js (or equivalent) file, all dependencies referenced will be concatenated together for output.
If directory, all compileable files will be compiled, wrapped in module definitions (js), and output to individual js/css files.

- *output*: file or directory to output to.

- *targets*: a nested target that prevents the duplication of source code with it's parent target.

- *modular*: a flag to prevent js files from being wrapped with a module definition.

- *output_compressed*: an alternate file or directory to use for compressed output.

### MODULES

Each js file is wrapped in a module declaration based on the file's location. Dependencies are determined by the use of ```require()``` statements:

```javascript
var lib = require('./my/lib'); // in current package
var SomeClass = require('../someclass'); // in parent package
var util = require('utils/util'); // from root package

lib.doSomething();
var something = new SomeClass();
util.log('hey');
```

Specifying a module's public behaviour is achieved by decorating an ```exports``` object:

```javascript
var myModuleVar = 'my module';

exports.myModuleMethod = function() {
  return myModuleVar;
};
```

...or overwriting the ```exports``` object completely:

```javascript
function MyModule() {
  this.myVar = 'my instance var';
};

MyModule.prototype.myMethod = function() {
  return this.myVar;
};

module.exports = MyModule;
```

Each module is provided with a ```module```, ```exports```, and ```require``` reference.

When ```require()```-ing a module, keep in mind that the module id is resolved based on the following rules:

 * packages begin at the root folder specified in *build > js > sources*:
```
'Users/alex/project/src/package/main.js' > 'package/main'
```
 * uppercase filenames are converted to lowercase module ids:
```
'my/package/Class.js' > 'my/package/class'
```

See [node.js modules](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) for more info on modules.

***NOTE***: ```require``` boilerplate needs to be included in the browser to enable module loading. It's recommended to ```install``` a library like *popeindustries/browser-require* (npm: simple-browser-require).
